plg Send Custom Header
========================


This is the plugin referred to in [Making your Joomla Site fly with NGinx reverse proxy caching](https://www.bentasker.co.uk/documentation/joomla/219-making-your-joomla-site-fly-with-nginx-reverse-proxy-caching).

It was originally written for Joomla 2.5/3.x and there hasn't been any development on it in several years - it's no longer supported in any way.

I've not tested against Joomla 4, so it may or may not work.
